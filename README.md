# Resources used

* During the course of this assignment, I have used many ressoures which include but are not limited to mdn documentation, nodejs.com,expressjs.com, https://www.npmjs.com/, google api, CDN documentation.


* For this assigment,  the user has to intereact with the API through Insomnia to perfrom the CRUD operationl.
In order for that to happenmafter the  server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database,
one can  open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts. 

* The data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON. A test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
 can be perfomed.  The test will include create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database and one can  test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia which will allow  to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
